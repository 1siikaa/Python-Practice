# arithmetic operators
a = 2
b = 5
print(a+b) #addition
print(a-b) #subtraction
print(a*b) #multiplication
print(a/b) #division
print(a%b) #modulus
print(a**b) #exponentiation
print(a//b) #floor division

# assignment operator
x=9
x &=3 #bitwise and
print(x)
print(z:=3) #walrus operator
# <<= (left shift operator)
# >>= (right shift operator)
# ^= (bitwise xor operator)
# |= (bitwise or operator)
# &= (bitwise and operator)

# logical operator
# and (returns true if both statements are true)
# or  (returns true if one of the statements is true)
# not (reverse the result, returns false if the result is true)

# identity operators
# is (returns true if the both variables are the same object)
# is not (returns true if both variables are not the same object)

# membership operator
# in (returns true if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object)
# not in (returns true if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object)

# bitwise operators
# & - sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
# | - sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
# ^ - sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
# ~ - inverts all the bits
# << - zero fill leftshift operator - 
# >> - signed right shift operator -

# operator precedence
